**Project Overview**
Project usess CNN for Dog breed Classification. Given a dog image the model will estimate to identify the dogs breed. If an image finds a human, it will determine its a human.

**File descriptions**
- haarcascades: xml files that use openCV detector 
- imagesDS: test images for my dog breed classification
- saved_models: has the models saved from the runs
- dog_app.ipynb: Main jupyter notebook that contains all steps to run and process
